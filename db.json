Hire a bike from one of the blue Melbourne Bike Share stations, the closest to us is opposite the wonderful Smith & Deli at 111 Moor Street, a 4 minute walk away. Taxi or Uber Or if you have a car my Visitor's Parking Permit might be available - first in first served!",

     "interaction": "This is a very independent set up.  My rooms and another guest room is on Level 1.  We are all usually out and about enjoying Melbourne so it can be rare we run into each other but I'm always contactable on my phone.",
     "house_rules": "- Please call out 'h!' or 'bye' when you use the front door, it's nice to know who's around.  If you're uncomfortable doing this, please don't book! - Please ensure the front door is always locked and gently used - The house is just for myself, my personal guests and my Airbnb guests - It's ok to use the kitchen but not ok to bring home Cage Eggs - The records, the alcohol and the kitchen cabinets with rubber bands on them are just for my personal use - Please respect the check-in and check-out times, thank you :)",

I'm originally from New Zealand but moved to Melbourne 19 years ago. \nLike most people who arrive in this wonderful city we think we are going to move on, but as soon as we get here ... well, there are reasons no-one ever wants to leave!  I was lucky enough to find this great house in the best part of Fitzroy so here I still am.   I have a habit of collecting things hence all the vintage love around the house.  Over the last decade+ I've shared my home with hundreds people from all around the world.  Things I can't live without?  Friends, freedom, Fitzroy...  If you think my home sounds like your kind of pad I'd love to hear from you and know what brings you to Melbourne.",

     "neighborhood_overview": "Fitzroy is the oldest suburb in Melbourne and a great example of why Melbourne is regularly called the world's most livable city.  Fitzroy has very diverse residents; shops; bars, cafes and restaurants; all services; and interesting streetscapes. There are beautiful parks and gardens nearby, plus museums and galleries. It's very walkable and bike friendly. Most buildings are low rise, one or two stories, even though its only ten minutes walk to the centre of the city. In the Guidebook I have listed a few on my favourite local places - though I'm sure you'll find your own just by wandering around. Sometimes these inner city neighbourhoods can be noisy, but the townhouse is in a street with very little through traffic. During the day there is some activity because the house borders an office and commercial precinct.",
     "notes": "There is a printer and a scanner which you can use, subject to a fair use policy. Please see the Guidebook for more details after you make your booking.",
     "transit": "Public transport is excellent - three tram routes within a few minutes walk, and a CBD train station ten minutes walk to take you anywhere in the city. There are two Myki cards (the local public transport smart card) for guest use (these need to be recharged in a local shop). There is no on site parking, but there is unrestricted street parking in front of the house. The main car rental offices are 20 minutes walk or 10 minutes taxi ride in the central city.   From the airport, if you are not coming by taxi, the Skybus takes you to Southern Cross Station in the city where you can transfer onto one of the three tram routes, which are one minute walk from the station.",
     "access": "\"Tamerlane\" is all yours! You will have all the essentials - wifi, coffee and tea, condiments, shampoo, soap and conditioner in the bathroom, laundry and dishwashing detergents, umbrellas. There is a Nespresso coffee maker, with two Nespresso stores nearby in the city for extra supplies.",
     "interaction": "I will always be available via the AirBnB site to answer questions or resolve any issues during your stay.",
     "house_rules": "Respect the house and your residential neighbours.  - Please leave the house as you find it. - No parties, loud noise, or gatherings of non-residents.  - No loud noise after 10.00 pm or before 8.00 am.  - No smoking or pets. - No shoes in the house - enjoy the comfort of socks or bare feet!  - Please clean up after yourself in the kitchen and bathroom.  - Please water the upstairs and downstairs gardens.

     "neighborhood_overview": "Port Melbourne is one of Melbourne's most sought-after inner enclaves - a salty-aired, breezy, resort-like bayside neighbourhood - yet just 10 minutes by tram from the centre of the city.  Formerly a rough-edged wharfie zone, today Port is a delightful mix of high and low, old and new, teeming with quirky cafes, every flavour of restaurant or pub and shops of all kinds. Plus the beach, with its kilometres of bike and walking paths meandering along the waterfront, is just a few steps from my front door.  But what makes my 'hood' a truly special place to stay...  Well, if you like a real neighbourhood, not just a location, you'll love Port. It's a friendly, bustling place where Vince the barista extraordinaire  learns what coffee you like and has it ready for you before you ask - folks say hi as you run (or stroll) along the beach - and neighbours drop by for a natter. Come stay and see why my neighbours and I wouldn't live anywhere else!",
     "notes": "The whole house, suitable for 4-5 guests, may occasionally be available for the right guests at the right time. Please contact me if you're interested.",
     "transit": "Couldn't be easier! The tram and 10-minute access to the city is just a few blocks away, with guest metro passes available at the tram stop. Plus rent-a-bikes just out the front door. And easy walking to neighbourhood and bayside delights.",
     "access": "Access as much of my home as you like. Share the lounge, the kitchen, the courtyard with me if you like to hang out. Or stick to your own private room and bath if that's what you prefer. Expansive common area grounds, gym and pool are also yours to enjoy.",
     "interaction": "In my place, it's really up to you.  I've had quiet guests with their own plans who prefer to keep to themselves. And gregarious ones who jump in and live the local life with me and my congenial neighbours. All are welcome, always on your own terms.",
     "house_rules": "Pets possibly allowed - but you must contact me to discuss first. (Depends on how they're likely to get on  with resident top dog Boof!) No smoking inside please.   Other than that, I'd ask only that you keep shared areas tidy and be as respectful of my home as I would of yours.",

And my place is a frequent stopping off point for friends from around the globe - or for neighbours just dropping by on the way home from the tram. \n\nIf you stay with me, you'll find an easy-going home away from home here. I'll show you where everything is, you can help yourself any time, and feel welcome to join in for a drink or a chat. Or if you prefer to stay to yourself, that's cool too.\n\nAnd - if you let me stay in your home, you can be sure I'll treat it with the same care I hope for from guests in my own house.",

The area is green and residential but a walk, a tram or a short drive away, is all the action of Balaclava, Ripponlea and Elsternwick. Stroll down Orrong Road to Glover Station, our favourite eatery in Glen Eira Road or to Ripponlea Village for a fabulous brunch.  Walk down the Balaclava Road hill to eclectic Balaclava with its cafes, restaurants, bakeries and shops.  And tram back up the hill if you are feeling lazy. The St Kilda Esplanade, Luna Park and Ackland Street are a short tram ride away on the no 16 or 3A trams. Enjoy the tram a little longer and you are in Melbourne's CBD on either the no 16, 3 or 3A.  (The no 3 takes you to the City via a different route to Ackland Street and St Kilda Beach) Alternatively you can take the train from Balaclava Station to the city or the MCG.

Greenmeadows Gardens is around the corner and is a popular, leafy park for families and those just wanting to sit and read or walk their dogs.  Of course, Greyfriars has a lovely garden to relax in too. Markets on weekends like the famous St Kilda Esplanade Sunday Market and the Hank Marvin Markets in Alma Park are a weekend event with food trucks, produce and craft stalls.

I have also prepared a driving guide for those who wish to visit the Great Ocean Road and Otways (my favourite cycling destination) - what we highlight the sights the paid tours miss.   You can rent a car and all major car rental companies (Avis, Hertz, Thrifty and Budget) are within 1500 metres.

     "description": "You enter from a quiet heritage laneway, with bluestone stables and architectural remnants from the mid 1800's  through our workshop to the studio. It is three storeys and includes two bathrooms,  three bedrooms, living/kitchen, laundry, verandah and views over the rooftops. Two or three minutes walk to Brunswick, Smith or Gertrude streets. Close to all Fitzroy has to offer, yet peaceful at night. Our studio is down a quiet back lane in Fitzroy. we have 1 x Double, 1 x Queen plus 1 x Single beds. We can provide a cot suitable for 0 to about 3, or an extra single bed if you are a family of six. *You enter on the ground level through our workshop. When you enter through your doorway you will find a laundry with washing machine and a separate bathroom with shower and toilet. Also a small bedroom with a single bed. *On the middle level there is a fully equipped kitchen with dishwasher, microwave, fan-forced oven, and all you need to cook...that's if you can resist the many fabulous cafes i",
     "neighborhood_overview": "Fitzroy has been called \"the centre of the universe\" for good reasons! An exciting area with a focus on the visual and performing arts, food, fashion and independant retail. It takes about five/ten minutes to walk to the city and is close to the major hospitals and universities, Melbourne Museum and the Exhibition Building. Twenty minute walk to the Victoria Market, or a tram ride. Thirty minutes to Collingwood Children's Farm and artist's/farmer's markets. Much has been said of Brunswick St, running down the middle of Fitzroy and it's unique atmosphere and galleries, venues, bars and cafes. Gertrude St was the first block outside the city to be sub-divided and has many bluestone buildings from the 1860's that now house quirky be-spoke designer makers and \"stand alone\" retailers ...from men's hats at SMART, Alec to organic bread at Fatto a Mano. Gertrude St Projection Festival transforms the street in winter annually. Smith St epitomizes the incredible blend of cultures that call Fitzr",
     "notes": "You should be aware the house is over three levels, open plan and there are stairs. It is made of bluestone and recycled materials, was once an old stable, so quirky and atmospheric...not your average dwelling!",
     "transit": "A tram on every corner! The Smith/Gertrude Sts tram, the number 86 takes you down Bourke St into town. The Brunswick St tram, number 11, takes you down Collins St into town and to Docklands. The Nicholson St tram, number 96 takes you all the way to St. Kilda. Two minutes walk to Victoria Parade trams and buses.  Five minute walk to Johnston St buses. If you are driving we have on street parking,so it is sometimes difficult to find a spot. Better to use the many forms of public transport around us. A cab to the airport takes between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the traffic. Or catch a tram into the city and the airport bus from there. To get to Southern Cross Station (Spencer st station) take the Smith/Gertrude St tram number 86.",
     "access": "You will have the whole house to yourselves and your entrance is separate from ours. The backyard has a table and chairs so you can enjoy the garden. We can arrange car off street from time to time, by arrangement. This car space is not always available so feel free to ask.",
     "interaction": "We are close by and available to answer any questions you may have. It is a private self contained space and we will probably not see each other unless we meet in the garden....great spot to chat under the grapevine as the sun goes down.",
     "house_rules": "*Happy to work out special prices for kids under 12 *We have school age residents so the backyard is only for daytime use as we go to bed early. *Likewise this is not a place for parties, sorry. *Smoking outside or on the verandah. *rubbish and recycling needs to be in the relevant bins on tuesday nights. *you must wash your own dishes and keep the space clean.",
